In Generation III onward

The stat is rounded down if the result is a decimal. The stat is also rounded down before the Nature multiplier, if any, is applied.

HP = ((IV + (2 * Base) + (EV / 4) + 100) * Level / 100) + 10

Other_Stat = ((((IV + (2 * Base) + (EV / 4)) * Level) / 100) + 5) * Nature

These formulas mean that, aside from Shedinja's HP (which is always 1) the lowest a stat can ever possibly be is 4 (or, for the HP stat, 11).
